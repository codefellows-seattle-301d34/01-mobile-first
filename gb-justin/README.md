## Overview: 
We have a website that has a header with a navigation menu and blocks of text below the header. The navigation menu needs to be accessible on a smart phone or tablet by clicking on a menu-type symbol. The navigation menu should be shown when tapped on (or hovered over by a mouse, on desktop/laptop.) When the screen is displayed on a wider viewport, such as a laptop or desktop, the navigation menu should be displayed by default, and the menu shortcut symbol should not be displayed.
